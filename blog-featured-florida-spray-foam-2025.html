            <p class="lead">With energy costs rising 15% annually in Florida and extreme weather becoming more frequent, traditional insulation is failing homeowners when they need it most. Here's why spray foam insulation is becoming the preferred choice for Florida families.</p>
          </header>

            <h2>The Florida Energy Crisis: Rising Costs, Failing Solutions</h2>
            <p>Florida homeowners are facing an unprecedented energy crisis. According to the Florida Public Service Commission, residential electricity rates have increased by 15% annually over the past three years, with the average Florida household now spending over $2,400 per year on cooling costs alone.</p>
            
            <div class="alert alert-info">
              <h4>💡 Did You Know?</h4>
              <p class="mb-0">The average Florida home loses 40-60% of its conditioned air through inadequate insulation, forcing HVAC systems to work overtime and driving up energy bills.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Why Traditional Insulation Fails in Florida</h3>
            <p>Traditional fiberglass and cellulose insulation were designed for moderate climates, not Florida's extreme conditions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Heat and Humidity:</strong> Traditional insulation absorbs moisture, reducing effectiveness by up to 50%</li>
              <li><strong>Air Leaks:</strong> Gaps and cracks allow conditioned air to escape and hot air to enter</li>
              <li><strong>Settling:</strong> Over time, traditional insulation compresses, creating gaps</li>
              <li><strong>Pest Problems:</strong> Rodents and insects easily penetrate traditional insulation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Spray Foam Solution: Why It Works in Florida</h2>
            <p>Spray foam insulation addresses every weakness of traditional insulation while providing additional benefits specifically valuable in Florida's climate:</p>

            <h3>1. Superior Air Sealing</h3>
            <p>Unlike traditional insulation that sits between studs, spray foam expands to fill every crack, gap, and crevice, creating a complete air barrier. This eliminates the air leaks responsible for 40% of energy loss in typical homes.</p>

            <h3>2. Moisture Resistance</h3>
            <p>Closed-cell spray foam is impermeable to water vapor, preventing the moisture problems that plague traditional insulation in Florida's humid climate. This means consistent performance year-round.</p>

            <h3>3. Structural Benefits</h3>
            <p>Spray foam adds structural strength to your home, which is particularly valuable during Florida's hurricane season. Studies show spray foam can increase wall strength by up to 300%.</p>
